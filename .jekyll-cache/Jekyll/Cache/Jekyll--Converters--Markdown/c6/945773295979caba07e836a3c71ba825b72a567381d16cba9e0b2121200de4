I"<p>This is a single family house designed by Japanese studio Kengo Kuma and Associates. We are the architects responsible for adapting, developing and the construction on its site in Spain.</p>

<p>The project, located in an olive field, pretends to fade with the landscape throughout itâ€™s geometry between two levels, using the actual local materials from the surroundings to integrate mimetically in the environment. A reflection about techniques and local solutions applied in a contemporary disruptive way. All together with a meticulous and delicate development throughout  all the house. The space fades between interior and exterior, the cover and the layout.</p>

<p>Area: 200 sqm</p>
